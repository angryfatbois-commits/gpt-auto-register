# Eligibility Checks: TDD Evidence

## Source

The user journeys and acceptance criteria were derived during the gated
`orch-add-feature` workflow. The implementation is clean-room: protocol facts
were researched, but source code, tests, fixtures, comments, and opaque custom
payment method constants were not copied from the unlicensed reference
repository.

## User journeys

1. As an account operator, I want to see whether a saved Free account is
   eligible for the exact `plus-1-month-free` campaign so that I do not confuse
   another offer with the requested Plus trial.
2. As an account operator, I want to explicitly probe GCash availability so
   that I can distinguish `eligible`, `ineligible`, and inconclusive accounts.
3. As a security-conscious operator, I want the GCash probe to stop before
   checkout confirmation or payment start so that an eligibility check cannot
   execute a payment.
4. As a WebUI user, I want persisted English status labels and the last
   conclusive result so that transient network failures do not erase useful
   evidence.

## RED evidence

The initial backend suite was run before production modules or endpoints
existed:

```text
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
FAILED (errors=9)
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'eligibility'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gcash_probe'
ImportError: cannot import name 'CheckGCashReq' from 'webui.app'
AttributeError: module 'webui.db' has no attribute 'update_eligibility_check'
```

The initial frontend logic test also failed before its implementation existed:

```text
npm test
ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: webui/frontend/src/eligibility.js
```

Additional boundary tests were introduced and observed RED for dynamic custom
method discovery, best-effort taxes, missing Plus plan evidence, log redaction,
and checkout-session path injection before the corresponding fixes were made.

No RED checkpoint commit was created because the governing Gate 2 requires
explicit user confirmation before any commit.

## GCash policy-change evidence

The requested policy change was tested before and after the classifier edit:

```text
python -m unittest tests.test_gcash_probe.GCashClassificationTests -v
RED: 5 failures in the positive-amount, missing-evidence, and conflict cases
GREEN: 10 tests passed after the classifier update
```

The full backend suite then passed with 45 tests. The new cases guarantee that
zero and positive PHP amounts are eligible, while absent GCash, missing or
conflicting evidence, and negative amounts are conclusively ineligible.

## Test specification

| # | What is guaranteed | Test target | Type | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Only the exact `plus-1-month-free` campaign is trial-eligible | `tests/test_eligibility.py` | Unit | PASS |
| 2 | Active, deactivated, Free/no-offer, malformed, and missing-plan states are classified explicitly | `tests/test_eligibility.py` | Unit | PASS |
| 3 | Authorization, cookie, and proxy credentials are redacted from diagnostic text | `tests/test_eligibility.py` | Security unit | PASS |
| 4 | GCash requires explicit method, PHP currency, and a present non-negative amount; zero and positive amounts are eligible | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Unit | PASS |
| 5 | Missing, conflicting, negative, and wrong-currency evidence is conclusively ineligible | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Unit | PASS |
| 6 | A live custom method ID is discovered and then verified; no copied ID is embedded | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Transport contract | PASS |
| 7 | The probe calls checkout/update/taxes/resolve/Stripe only and never confirm/start | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Security integration | PASS |
| 8 | Upstream session IDs cannot inject a different path | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Security unit | PASS |
| 9 | API input is deduplicated and bounded, missing tokens are safe, and one failure does not abort the batch | `tests/test_eligibility_api.py` | API integration | PASS |
| 10 | Safe results persist without a schema migration and preserve the last conclusive verdict | `tests/test_eligibility_db.py` | Database integration | PASS |
| 11 | English GCash summaries, details, and status colors remain stable | `webui/frontend/tests/eligibility.test.mjs` | Frontend unit | PASS |
| 12 | Plus requests cannot follow redirects while carrying authorization and cannot silently select another account | `tests/test_eligibility_api.py`, `tests/test_eligibility.py` | Security regression | PASS |
| 13 | GCash requires backend side-effect acknowledgement and either loopback access or a matching reverse-proxy admin token | `tests/test_eligibility_api.py` | API security integration | PASS |
| 14 | Concurrent Plus and GCash persistence cannot overwrite the other result | `tests/test_eligibility_db.py` | Concurrency integration | PASS |
| 15 | A failed promotion update is inconclusive and stops before later checkout stages | `tests/test_gcash_probe.py` | Transport contract | PASS |
| 16 | Element Plus, project-owned UI text, and shipped static assets are English-only | `webui/frontend/tests/english-ui.test.mjs` | Frontend/build regression | PASS |

## GREEN evidence

Backend suite:

```text
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
Ran 45 tests
OK
```

Frontend suite:

```text
npm --prefix webui/frontend test
tests 6, pass 6, fail 0
```

Production frontend:

```text
npm --prefix webui/frontend run build
1702 modules transformed
built successfully
```

Additional validation:

```text
python -m compileall -q eligibility.py gcash_probe.py webui tests
compileall: OK

python -m pip check
No broken requirements found.

npm --prefix webui/frontend audit --omit=dev --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

## Coverage

The environment did not include the third-party `coverage.py` package. Python's
standard-library `trace` module was used instead, with no new project
dependency:

```text
eligibility.py  93.7%
gcash_probe.py  88.3%
```

Both new backend modules exceed the required 80% line coverage.

## Known gaps

- Tests use dependency-injected fake transports and deliberately do not contact
  live ChatGPT or Stripe endpoints. A live result requires authorized account
  credentials and a suitable regional proxy.
- The upstream endpoints are not stable public APIs; unexpected response shapes
  are treated as `ineligible` by the requested checkout-evidence policy. Pure
  transport/authentication failures still produce `unknown` because no usable
  evidence was obtained.
- The existing application has no built-in WebUI authentication or global rate
  limiter. It should remain bound to localhost or be placed behind an
  authenticated TLS reverse proxy.
- The original lockfile references a third-party npm mirror that is blocked by
  the local runtime policy. Validation installed the same manifest versions from
  the official npm registry without replacing the project lockfile wholesale.

## Merge evidence

RED and GREEN were both captured in this report. The change remains uncommitted
until the user approves Gate 2.
